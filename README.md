## Overview
AI Tab Groups is a Chrome extension that uses the experimental AI Language Model API to intelligently categorize and group your browser tabs.

This extension allows you to automatically group tabs based on their content and purpose, making it easy to manage and access your tabs efficiently.

When you open a new tab, AI Tab Groups will analyze its content and generate tags that best categorize it. 
It then displays these tags in a floating message box, allowing you to quickly choose the most relevant group.
